# Flutter chess game

Flutter chess game fully written on dart. In dependencies only [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) library.

## Features

I work with this repo only when I've a free time. But I don't have enough )))

My main Idea is:

- Separate logic and presentation ✅
  - Models: contains logic
  - UI: contains all ui widgets
  - bloc: use for binder between model and ui  
- Create logic that calculates available way for figure ✅
- Add "winning" logic | <b>in progress</b> 👨‍💻|
  - Сheckmate logic
- Players take turns moving figures ✅
- Add AI for playing with player | <b>in hoping</b> 🤖|
